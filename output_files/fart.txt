And now, farts of all kinds, small puffs and grand thunderous blasts, gather around and be acknowledged in your diverse glory. Let's not conceal our scents, for every expulsion adds character to the chorus of life, adding tempo and rhythm to the day. Whether silent whispers or roaring gales, each contributes to the symphony. Oh farts, you are as varied as the leaves in the wind, each performance unique and unrepeatable. We salute your humble presence, you unseen performers of nature's play.
